metasploit framework have total of 6 modules which are listed below : 
1. Auxiliary : Any supporting modules such are scanners,crawlers and fuzzers can found here.

2. Encoders : Encoders will allow to encode the payload so that any signiture based antiviruses may miss them. An signiture based antivirus have a database of known threats.
Thus they compare a file with that database to find any suspicious file and my check additionl checks on the payloads, so the encoded payloads have limited success rates.

3. Evasion : While Encoders will encode the payload, they shouldn't considerd as direct attemt to evade or bypass the antivirus software. Then evasion module comes in with high 
or less success reate as compare to the encoders.

4. Exploit : exploit is nothing but a weakness in a system that we can take an advantage of to compromise the system

NOP's : NOPs or "No Operations"  Do nothing and can be found in the x86 intel CPU with family 0x90. This module we can use to achive a buffer to consist of a perticular
size of an payload.

5. Payload :

Post : Post module is used to post expoloitation in penetration test
